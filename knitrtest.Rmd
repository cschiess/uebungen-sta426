Knitr Test
=========

We test some Knitr stuff like code 

```{r sd}
x<- rlnorm(1000, meanlog=1, sdlog=0.25)
```
and figures

```{r}
hist(x)
```

On a logarithmic scale it looks like a normal distribution as expected.
```{r}
hist(log(x))
```

We have mean `r mean(x)` and variance `r var(x)`. The expected values would be `r exp(1+0.25^2/2)` and `r (exp(0.25^2)-1)*exp(2*1+0.25^2)`.
